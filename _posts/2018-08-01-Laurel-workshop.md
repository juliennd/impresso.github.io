The second impresso workshop (Laurel) took place on 5 and 6 July on the EPFL campus in Lausanne. It was preceded by a [seminar]({{"https://agenda.unil.ch/display?id=1523877987757" dedicated to the practice of history in the digital age (L’histoire contemporaine à l’ère numérique: sources, méthodologies, critiques, #JEhistNUM) held on the neighbouring UNIL campus and organised by Frédéric Clavert (C2DH), Solenn Huitric (UNIL), Enrico Natale (infoclio.ch) and Raphaëlle Ruppen-Coutaz (UNIL). A report will be made available via infoclio.ch. During this UNIL seminar, historians and archivists discussed the changes that have occurred with the advent of the digital era and presented their research and document collection practices in the specific fields of diplomatic documents, born-digital web archives and, of course, digitised newspapers. The third type of historical sources was represented by Guillaume Pinson from the Numapresse project and Estelle Bunout from impresso. The dialogue between both projects fuelled discussions over the following days, reflecting the underlying common challenges and complementary approaches.
